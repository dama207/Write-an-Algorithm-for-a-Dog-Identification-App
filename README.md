# An Algorithm for a Dog Identification App

This project is about deployment of an algorithm that has the goal of classify images. ThisÂ  algorithm can detect if an image have a human or dog, also which is the breed of dog. For reach this goal, this used a neural network CNN and the technic of transfer learning.

# Libraries used

- sklearn.
- keras.
- numpy.
- glob.
- pandas.
- matplotlib.
- random.
- cv2.
- tqdm.

# Dataset

The data set has 8,351 total images with 133 different breeds. 

# Steps

- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dog
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Write the Algorithm
- Step 6: Test the Algorithm

# Results of the analysis

The performance of algorithm is good, however, there are images that the algorithm classified wrong like the drawing of a human. This algorithm could improve with next points:

- Provide a larger training set. 
- Used a detector face human that does not need that face is well oriented. 
- Use more images of dogs in the train task.
